Problem 3.	Circle Perimeter and Area

Write a program that reads the radius r of a circle and prints its perimeter and area formatted with 2 digits after the decimal point.


Problem 4.	Number Comparer

Write a program that gets two numbers from the console and prints the greater of them. Try to implement this without if statements.


Problem 5.	Formatting Numbers

Write a program that reads 3 numbers: an integer a (0 ≤ a ≤ 500), a floating-point b and a floating-point c and prints them in 4 virtual columns on the console. Each column should have a width of 10 characters. The number a should be printed in hexadecimal, left aligned; then the number a should be printed in binary form, padded with zeroes, then the number b should be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point, right aligned; the number c should be printed with 3 digits after the decimal point, left aligned. 


Problem 6. Quadratic Equation
Write a program that reads the coefficients a, b and c of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 and solves it (prints its real roots). 


Problem 7. Sum of 5 Numbers
Write a program that enters 5 numbers (given in a single line, separated by a space), calculates and prints their sum.


Problem 8. Numbers from 1 to n
Write a program that reads an integer number n from the console and prints all the numbers in the interval [1..n], each on a single line. Note that you may need to use a for-loop.


Problem 9. Sum of n Numbers
Write a program that enters a number n and after that enters more n numbers and calculates and prints their sum. Note that you may need to use a for-loop.


Problem 10.	Fibonacci Numbers
Write a program that reads a number n and prints on the console the first n members of the Fibonacci sequence (at a single line, separated by spaces) : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, …. Note that you may need to learn how to use loops.


Problem 11.	Numbers in Interval Dividable by Given Number
Write a program that reads two positive integer numbers and prints how many numbers p exist between them such that the reminder of the division by 5 is 0.
